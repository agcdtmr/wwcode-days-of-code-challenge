:rocket: Hey everyone! Anj here, Filipina-Dutch based in Europe.

Excited to kick off the 2024 coding challenge today!

I've made something that might make the journey smoother - a personalized progress tracker. :bar_chart:

It's got checkboxes for everything on my to-do list, keeping me on track and organized.

Includes daily coding goals, reminders for writing stellar commit messages, celebrating wins, supporting others on Slack, community networking through Hopin or Slack channels, appreciation for WWCode volunteers, and self-care reminders!

I'd love your input to make it even better â€“ if I missed something or if there's more you'd like to see, let me know!

Here's the link to the tracker: WWCode Days of Code Challenge 2024 Tracker

Would love to endorse your skills and follow you on LinkedIn too: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anjcalleja/

Let's conquer these coding goals together and make 2024 a year of incredible achievements! :computer::sparkles:
